A boring window switcher for X11 desktop environments.

Unlike many other window switchers, this is NOT a daemon. This is just a regular Gtk+ application that shows windows currently open, and raises the window the user selects. It does not do any tricky keyboard grabbing.


## How to Install

TBW. (It's a Haskell program installable by `cabal`).

## How to Run

 $ boring-window-switcher
